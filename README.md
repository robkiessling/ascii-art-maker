## Why use this tool?

This tool has many advantages over a normal text editor, such as:

- Drawing
  - Draw characters on the right side of the image without having to add spaces to get there
  - Easily move sections of the ASCII image around
  - Rectangle / line drawing helpers
  - Layer support
  - Reference sheet for extended ASCII characters
- Animating (multiple frames)
  - Ability to easily duplicate and re-order your frames
  - Ability to copy a section of one frame to all frames
  - Onion tool to see previous frame
  - Continuously preview the animation as you're working on it
- Exporting
  - Export your art as `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.json` and more
  - Handles escaping characters like `\` and `"`

## What this tool doesn't do

This tool does not convert images to ASCII; it is designed to aid the manual drawing of ASCII art/animations.
